## Assignment 5	

In this assignment you will design and train a backpropagation network to learn the exclusive-OR function.  Try using the same learning rate in all cases.

1.	Use one hidden layer with 4 hidden units, binary representation and binary sigmoid. Plot the error as a function of the number of iterations.
2.	Repeat (1) using bipolar sigmoid and bipolar representation for exclusive-OR function.
3.	Repeat (1) using two hidden layers (3 units in the first hidden layer and 2 units in the second hidden layer).
